# Digital Clock

## About

This program displays a digital clock with the current time. Rather than render 
numeric characters directly, the sevseg.py module from Project 64, “Seven-Segment 
Display Module,” generates the drawings for each digit. This program is similar 
to Project 14, “Countdown.”
